HOW TO INSTALL
==============
1. Upload all files to your server
2. If caching is enabled (default) then you must create a directory in the same folder as odp.php called 'cache' and make it writeable by odp.php (chmod 777)

*finished*

Note: delcache.php is used to delete the cache directory. For security reasons it needs to be renamed to run.
Use testscript.php if you experience any problems. If you don't have any problems, just delete the file.

If you want, you can:
- Use a different button image than the original one that links to bie.no. The archive you downloaded contains a few different, and you can find more
  here -> http://www.bie.no/products/phpodp/banners/buttons/ .. pick one that fits your site!
- Edit the files in the includes/ directory give it the same design as the rest of your site
- Set a couple of options in odp.php (eg. show thumbnails, or show amazon sponsor link)

dmoz.org contains a lot of adult sites by default (see dmoz.org/Adult). If you do not want these categories on your site, please set $adult_filter to true in odp.php.
You may also block certain searches there. Edit includes/block.php to change the message the user sees when he tries to do a blocked search or browse blocked category.
