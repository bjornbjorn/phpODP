Version 1.5d - 04/07/2004
=========================
- Search in: entire directory / only in <category name> is implemented
- Enable only browse caching / search caching or both.
- Focus request on search input field on main page (wee! like Google has!)
- Adult filter; possibility to block browsing of /Adult/ categories and specific searches (set $adult_filter to true to enable this)
- Very simple cache maintainance tool (enables you to delete the cache folder via your browser) - delcache.php (must be renamed to work)

Bugfixes:
---------
- International characters would be messed up in the portal page go.php
- Previously phpODP would cache the result from the ODP that stated 'The Open Directory Project is currently under heavy load'.
  Then it would show that page until the cache expired. This is now fixed.

==========================
- Fixed problems with categories that had a ' int their name 
- Fixed bug with portal page not always working (Thanks to Arno in the forum)
